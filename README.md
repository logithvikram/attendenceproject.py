# Attendance using Face Recognition


This Python code uses the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to perform real-time face recognition from a webcam feed, matching the faces to a set of known images in a directory.<br />

The code records the time of attendance for each recognized face and stores the data in a CSV file.<br />

1.Requirements<br />
This code requires OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to be installed on your machine.<br />

2.Usage<br />
Simply run the Python code to start the webcam feed and begin face recognition.<br />

3.Notes<br />
This code is intended for educational purposes only and may require modification to suit specific use cases.<br />

4.Acknowledgements<br />
This code is based on the work of various developers, including the OpenCV and face_recognition communities.<br />
