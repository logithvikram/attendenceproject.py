Attendance using Face Recognition
This Python code uses the OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to perform real-time face recognition from a webcam feed, matching the faces to a set of known images in a directory.

The code records the time of attendance for each recognized face and stores the data in a CSV file.

Requirements
This code requires OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to be installed on your machine.

Usage
Simply run the Python code to start the webcam feed and begin face recognition.
